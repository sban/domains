## Background
Inspired by Halliday (2004), I distinguish between three overall domains of experience, which, respectively, relate to doing, sensing and being.

The first domain (doing) concerns  experience of the outer world and processes related to actions and events. It concerns doing something in the physical world. This domain is further divided into two types of doing: *material doings* defined as outer processes, and *behavioral doings*, defined as manifestations of inner workings.

The second (being) domain concerns what  the experience of identification and classification; it concerns things in the world of relations. The domain is divided into two types of being: *existential being*, conveyed with verbs representing action surrounding the main character or object of the story (e.g., "there are..."), and *relational actions* that includes processes of being (e.g., "x is a" or "x is at a"). 


Finally, the third domain (sensing) concerns intersubjective experience; it relates to the subject sensing something (an object) in the world of consciousness. This domain is divided into two types.  *Verbal actions* involve all types of processes of saying and communication. *Mental actions* involve processes that are going on inside ourselves and is divided into four subtypes: *perspective* (feeling, sensing), *cognitive* (believing, thinking), *desiderative* (wanting, wishing), and *emotive* (enjoying, hating).
