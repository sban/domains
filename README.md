# domains: My operationalization of Halliday's domains of experiences

Inspired by Halliday (2004), I distinguish between three overall domains of experience, which, respectively, relate to doing, sensing and being. The first domain concerns experience of the outer world and processes related to actions and events; it concerns doing something in the physical world. This domain is further divided into two types of doing: material doings, defined as outer processes, and expressional doings, defined as manifestations of inner workings. The interviewees narratively convey material doings using verbs representing productive processes (e.g. ‘I go to work’) and expressional doings with verbs representing creative processes (e.g. ‘I design’). The second domain concerns what we experience as going on inside ourselves; it relates to sensing something in the world of consciousness. This domain is divided into four types of sensing: verbal (e.g. ‘I talk’), mental (e.g. ‘I understand’), emotional (e.g. ‘I fear’) and visual (e.g. ‘I look’). Finally, the third domain concerns the experience of identification and classification; it concerns things in the world of relations. The third domain is divided into two types of being: existential being, conveyed with verbs representing who we are (e.g. ‘I am’) and relational being, defined as representations of what we possess (e.g. ‘I have’).
